## Flashbots NFT Minter ü§ñ‚ö°Ô∏è

This is a custom implementation of a custom NFT minter using flashbots relay.

It is configured via `.env` file (on its first version), and it enables you to escape the Dark Forest when trying to collect your so valued NFTs

### How does it work? ‚öôÔ∏è

1. Copy the `.env.example` file into a `.env` file
2. Fill the values according to [reference](#Reference)
3. Just go to your terminal and run `yarn start`

‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING: At the moment, the bot keeps sending the buy bundle to the network, it doesn't stop once the transaction has been included
